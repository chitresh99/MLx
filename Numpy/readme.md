What is numpy ?

-> NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning due to its ability to handle large datasets and perform complex calculations quickly.


NumPy is primarily used for mathematical calculations. It offers:

Array and Matrix Operations: Efficient handling and manipulation of large datasets.
Mathematical Functions: A wide range of functions for performing operations such as statistical analysis, linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and more.
Performance: Optimized for speed, making it much faster than traditional Python lists for numerical tasks.
Integration: Easily integrates with other libraries like SciPy, pandas, and matplotlib for scientific computing and data visualization.

NumPy is a fundamental tool for numerical and scientific computing in Python.

The core of the Numpy package is the ndarray object . This encapulates n-dimensional arrays of homogenous data types 

Basically arrays which has the same datatype

Why do we need numpy

Python is slow if we have big data the processing is slow , in machine learning we have gb's of data 

Numpy was written in c but a wrapper was created around it 

Numpy provides a powerful data structure called nd array which is used to store and manipulate numerical data in a highly efficient manner

What's the difference between arrays and python sequence 
-> 1) Size of numpy array is fixed and python sequence is dynamic 
-> 2) Changing the size of ndarray will delete the old array and create a one one
-> 3) The elements in numpy array are required to have the same data type 
-> 4) If we want to perform operations on difficult mathematical operations we get a lot of convinience from numpy
-> 5) All of these python libraries use numpy

Summary 
-> Numpy is a scientific computing library 
-> There is a thing main thing which is called numpy array
-> Why was there a need for numpy because the data types python had were itself slow
-> Python is the god father of data science
